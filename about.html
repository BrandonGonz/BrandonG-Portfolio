        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
          My mission is to leverage technology, mentorship, and community
          engagement to empower individuals with limited access to
          opportunities. Through resilience, continuous learning, and
          collaboration, I aim to create meaningful change by breaking barriers
          in tech and fostering a culture of inclusivity and innovation.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m someone who finds joy in both adventure and connection. Whether
          it's playing basketball, going on hikes, or exploring new places, I
          love staying active and discovering what the world has to offer. But
          beyond that, I truly value quality over quantity—especially when it
          comes to the time I spend with friends and family. There’s nothing
          better than meaningful conversations, shared experiences, and creating
          lasting memories. When I’m not out and about, I enjoy unwinding with a
          good series, appreciating the storytelling and creativity that comes
          with it.
